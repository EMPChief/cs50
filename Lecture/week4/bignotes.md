### Pixels
- Pixels on a computer are represented using RGB color. The RGB color model consists of a 3D vector where (0,0,0) represents black and (255,255,255) represents white.
- In the RGB model, red is denoted by FF 00 00, green by 00 FF 00, and blue by 00 00 FF in software like Photoshop.
- The hex color codes #000000 and #FFFFFF are used to represent black and white respectively.
- Hex color codes use the characters 0-9 and A-F (or a-f) to represent colors in base-16, where 0 is the smallest value and FF is the largest.
- Examples of hex color codes include #FF0000 for red, #00FF00 for green, #0000FF for blue, #FF00FF for magenta, #00FFFF for cyan, #FFFFFF for white, and #000000 for black.
