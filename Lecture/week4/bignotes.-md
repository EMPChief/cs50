- On a computer, we can use RGB color to represent pixels. (0,0,0) is black and (255,255,255) is white. RGB color is a 3D vector.
- RGB stands for red, green, and blue colors. In Photoshop and other software, red is FF 00 00, green is 00 FF 00, and blue is 00 00 FF.
- We can use #000000 for black and #FFFFFF for white.
- In the graphic world, we use hex color codes that use 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F to represent colors in base-16. (0-9 and A-F, upper or lower case does not matter in hex color codes).
- 0 is smallest and FF is largest.
- For example, #FF0000 is red, #00FF00 is green, #0000FF is blue, #FF00FF is magenta, #00FFFF is cyan, #FFFFFF is white, and #000000 is black.
