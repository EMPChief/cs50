   - `\d`: Matches any digit
   - `\w`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric plus underscore)
2. **Quantifiers**: Specify how many times a pattern should be matched
   - `*`: Zero or more occurrences
   - `+`: One or more occurrences
   - `{n}`: Exactly n occurrences
   - `{min,max}`: Between min and max occurrences
3. **Anchors**: Specify the position of matches in a string
   - `^`: Start of the string
   - `$`: End of the string
   - `\b`: Word boundary
   - `\B`: Not a word boundary
4. **Groups**: Allow capturing matched text and creating subexpressions
   - `(pattern)`: Creates a capturing group
5. **Lookarounds**: Allow matching based on what precedes or follows a pattern
